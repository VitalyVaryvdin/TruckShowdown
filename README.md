Very old and forgotten at early stages project of young me. First serious project when i was studying C++, and very first project involving games. Scene included simulates beach buggy using constraints method.

Doesn't build as is as it depends on a lot of things which are missing here currently. I might update it some day.

Was built using Ogre3D, Buillet & OgreBullet, Lua & LuaBind, OpenAL & OgreOggSound.
