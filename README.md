Very old and forgotten at early stages project of young me. First serious project when i was studying C++, and very first project involving games. Scene included beach buggy simulation using constraints method at some point (this is where name comes from) and removed later during script integration, after that project was layed off.

Doesn't build as is as it depends on a lot of things which are missing here currently. I might update it some day.

Was built using Ogre3D, Buillet & OgreBullet, Lua & LuaBind, OpenAL & OgreOggSound.
